[{"copyright":"Koen van Gorp","date":"2007-12-08","explanation":"Just fix your camera to a tripod and you too can make an image of graceful trails traced by the stars as planet Earth rotates on its axis. Made on September 14 from Montlaux, France, this wide-angle view nicely shows the stars near the celestial equator tracing nearly straight lines in projection, while stars north and south of the equator, respectively, appear to circle the north and south celestial poles. Featured are the stars of Orion (right of center), brilliant Venus rising (left) as bright star Sirius rises in the south (bottom center), and a polar orbiting Iridium satellite (upper left). Beautiful dawn sky colors seem painted along the horizon. This remarkable picture was constructed from 477 consecutive 30 second digital exposures recorded over 4.3 hours and later combined.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0712/2007_09_14-orion-lq_vanGorp1200.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Star Trails at Dawn","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0712/2007_09_14-orion_vanGorp800.jpg","id":"1"},

{"date":"1996-10-21","explanation":"Tonight you might be able to see Halley's\r Comet again - or at least some pieces of it. It is widely thought\r that that the meteors from the Orionids meteor shower,\r which peaks tonight, are just small pieces of Halley's Comet\r falling to Earth. During each pass near the Sun, a comet will\r heat up and shed pieces of ice and rock\r from its nucleus. This debris\r continues to orbit the Sun until\r either evaporating or being swept up by some large solar-system\r body. A piece of comet debris striking the Moon\r creates a small crater, but a piece striking the Earth usually\r burns up in the atmosphere causing\r a brief, bright streak.\r Every year at this time the Earth crosses an old stream of bits\r from Halley's\r Comet causing the Orionids display, named from the constellation\r (Orion) from which the meteors appear to originate. The streak below center in the above picture of the northern sky actually depicts a meteor from the Perseid meteor shower,\r a usually even more impressive display that peaks every year in\r mid-August.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/perseid_vw.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Orionids Meteor Shower to Peak Tonight \r\nCredit:","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/perseid_vw.gif"},
{"date":"2006-10-17","explanation":"If you could stand on Mars -- what might you see?  Like the robotic Opportunity rover rolling across the red planet, you might well see vast plains of red sand, an orange tinted sky, and wispy light clouds.  The Opportunity rover captured just such a vista after arriving at Victoria Crater earlier this month, albeit in a completely different direction from the large crater.  Unlike other Martian vistas, few rocks are visible in this exaggerated color image mosaic.  The distant red horizon is so flat and featureless that it appears similar to the horizon toward a calm blue ocean on Earth.  Clouds on Mars can be composed of either carbon dioxide ice or water ice, and can move quickly, like clouds move on Earth.  The red dust in the Martian air can change the sky color above Mars from the blue that occurs above Earth toward the red, with the exact color depending on the density and particle size of the floating dust particles.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0610/marshorizon_opportunity_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Clouds and Sand on the Horizon of Mars","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0610/marshorizon_opportunity.jpg"},
{"copyright":"Peter TuthillSydney U.Cornell","date":"2011-03-23","explanation":"What could cause a nebula to appear square? No one is quite sure. The hot star system known as MWC 922, however, appears to be embedded in a nebula with just such a shape.  The above image combines infrared exposures from the Hale Telescope on Mt. Palomar in California, and the Keck-2 Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.  A leading progenitor hypothesis for the square nebula is that the central star or stars somehow expelled cones of gas during a late developmental stage. For MWC 922, these cones happen to incorporate nearly right angles and be visible from the sides.  Supporting evidence for the cone hypothesis includes radial spokes in the image that might run along the cone walls. Researchers speculate that the cones viewed from another angle would appear similar to the gigantic rings of supernova 1987A, possibly indicating that a star in MWC 922 might one day itself explode in a similar supernova.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1103/redsquare_tuthill_1024.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"MWC 922: The Red Square Nebula","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1103/redsquare_tuthill_900.jpg"},
{"date":"2010-11-16","explanation":"Is this what will become of our Milky Way Galaxy? Perhaps if we collide with the Andromeda Galaxy in a few billion years, it might. Pictured above is NGC 7252, a jumble of stars created by a huge collision between two large galaxies.  The collision will take hundreds of millions of years and so is effectively caught frozen in time in the above image.  The resulting pandemonium has been dubbed the Atoms-for-Peace galaxy because of its similarity to a cartoon of a large atom.  The above image was taken recently by the MPG/ESO 2.2 meter telescope in Chile. NGC 7252 spans about 600,000 light years and lies about 220 million light years away toward the constellation of the Water Bearer (Aquarius). Since the sideways velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is presently unknown, no one really knows for sure if the Milky Way will ever collide with M31.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1011/ngc7252_eso_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Atoms-for-Peace Galaxy Collision","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1011/ngc7252_eso.jpg"}]
